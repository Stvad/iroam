title: 'Pyroam - Usage'
---

The main thing you need to know are the two following keybindings:

| Keybinding         | Action           |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| <Alt+Enter>        | Run current cell and write |
| <Alt+Shift+Enter>  | Run all cells in *active notebook* and write |

When a codeblock is run, the output is written to the block nested one below it. 

The fastest way to add a Python codeblock in Roam is by typing `/python` and pressing Enter.

## Active notebooks

By default, the current page is the *active notebook*, i.e., when you press <Alt+Shift+Enter>, all blocks on the current page get run and their outputs are written. 

You can designate a smaller portion of the page to be the *active notebook* by referencing the page `[[pyroam/notebook]]` in the parent block, i.e. all blocks nested under this blocks will get run when pressing <Alt+Shift+Enter>, but no other. You can also nest notebooks - the plugin will always run the "smallest" one. 

All variables are shared, it's like if the code blocks were one script.

## Packages

Currently, `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `scipy` get loaded, though `numpy` tends to be buggy and plot generation with `matplotlib` doesn't work yet. 

In the future, the plugin will load all imported packages dynamically (as long as `pyodide`, the underlying Python browser compiler, allows it).
